time ago many projects related to smart city have been opened and laid outcompanions silvassa is the energy center of the economic activities of this entire region many industries are here and there are many possibilities for the industries here in the future the building of silvassa municipal corporation be a sewage treatment plant a project that facilitates connectivity it is all about making life easierdaman and diu along with the colleagues silvas have also given rise to development with the facilities like new pool new sewage line and treatment plant built on daman ganga life of oppressed people is going to be easy the sea wall built in thick suppression is now going to protect you from waves of the ocean with this the problem of soil erosion is going to be very low companions the last time i came here land leases were distributed to many tribal families i have had the opportunity to hand over some land rights letters to some of my colleagues todaygreat efforts are being made for the welfare of the tribals on every level brothers and sisters land plantation of forest studying talent related to sports in the forest produce under the fuel plan centers across the country are being set up for value addition and proper publicity efforts the right value for the tribals who produce the tribal sisterbrother from the forest can be found for this the scope of the support price has been increasedserious efforts are also being made to protect the culture along with the earnings of comrades tribals even today many projects related to history and cultural heritage have been started be a cultural center conservation of old castles be it a memorial site associated with ins khukri in diu it is definitely going to be proven in the preservation and promotion of local culturecompanions culture and pride this monument in history is our guardian of feelings and also employs many opportunities for the youth it gives strength to tourism there are many possibilities for tourism in dadra and nagar haveli the government is making every effort to bring this area on the tourist map this is the feeling behind the daman ganga river front built in silvassa now another center of attraction for tourists coming here is ready here apart from this there is also a reserve forest area of \\u200b\\u200b200 square km this is a boon for the forest area tourism

family names into modern motor boats fishermen have been created a special fund for easy and cheap loans to improve the system of fish production to better business arrangement of around rs7000 crore has been made through this fundbrothers and sisters today for tribals for the poor for the middle class everything is going on in the core of the schemes everyones development is our inspiration whereas the party that runs the government for decades in all its work or saw the possibilities of his family this is the reason that there has been an emphasis on more names than workcompanions we have changed habits of this old government system we have given attention to work rather than name what is the name of government schemes today there are many schemes like ayushman bharat scheme pradhan mantri awas yojana prime minister ujjwala yojana prime minister mudra yojana prime minister janhana yojna prime minister krishi irrigation scheme but there is no modi name anywhere it shows that our intention is to develop the public our culture of family development is neither our intention nor our intention and for me this hundred and fifty million people is my family and the welfare of these hundred and a hundred million people is the path of kalyan for mecompanions this clearly laid out policy and clear policy are trying to mislead them why are modi changing the old rituals of the government it is difficult to see why modi is doing such a tough fight against corruption should not or should not fight against corruption or should not fight should the country get rid of corruption or not it is a problem that why modi has removed the intermediaries roaming in the corridors of power he is getting angry that modi is snatching the rights of the poor his ration is his pension the right to get his rights why his grabbing middleman is throwing out brokers and because of this anger they are now trying to create a big coalition the condition is that those who first used to drink water for drinking congress have also come to a stagecompanions this great coalition is not just against modi but it is also against the people of the country right now its not even completely but how the bargain is going on the accounting is going on the transaction is going on this is also the youth of our country the countrys farmer the countrys first woman to vote for the first time the youth of our country is closely watching these things and there will not be any dust in these peoples eyescompanions the world of these people starts with hatred of modi and ends up abusing modi my world in the morning with the determination of the welfare of the hundred and fifty million people and on the night when i sweat through sweating throughout the day how much good work i have done today my idioms are the same my end also is the same their world is focused on moving forward to their family to their nephews and being declared with great pride brothers and sisters my world my hundred and twentieth million people moved forward it is for the same there is no vision for indias development in the world indias future is not a matter of fact at the same time my attempt is to make india the best country in the 21st centurybrothers and sisters their family how many combinations it can make to save their siddhanta they can not run away from their deeds their misdeeds are following them on the dargah they can not escape only modis opposition will give their politics of selfinterest in the newspapers will remain glittering in the media but in the hearts of the people of the country the people who destroy the country will never be able to make any place brothers and sisters you probably do not know people who get uprooted by the public when the people change their mood when their feet seem to be uncomfortable they become anxious just look at you in calcutta  the bharatiya janata party has only one mla in west bengal just one how many one but to avoid bjp there all the people of entire india have become interested a party with an mla has kept her sleepy because it is the people who walk on the path of truth in spite of being an mla all the jamaat people of india are shouting slogans save save and save them i congratulate the people of west bengal i congratulate the bharatiya janata party of west bengal the single mla so little party has slept the wrongdoers the land has dropped the fear of the slaughter is happeningbrothers and sisters these people are not dictators west bengal kerala dudardagar is oppressed in west bengal the political party is banned for the program every kind of democratic processes are done democracy is strangled then there is talk of saving the democracy by getting there and then i have to say that when i see the picture of west bengal then i would say that the election of the panchayat who thrives on democracy when people who are nominated to death are talking about saving democracy then the country comes out of the mouth wow what is the scene companions this fight is between positive thinking and negative attitude this fight is between development and corruption this fight is between the public and the general body brothers and sisters right thinking along with positive thinking is the way to create a new india on this path we all have to walk the people of the country at a fast pace this positivity is growing in our country and mind in the new year with this desire we are moving forward with the decision to take the country to new heights and brothers and sisters are watching you i have been walking since morning indias army should get the benefit of make in india strong tanks near indias army are made up of the country sometimes in the morning and worrying about them the army of the country to increase strength then today to make public security here i am working to get the medical college to the younger generation here brothers and sisters in calcutta people are gathering together to save the party and i am living with you to pursue the country by coming into your midst this difference is clear friends this difference is clear they are looking for shelter to save themselves i have been moving everyone along with the development of the country all the development and progress of the country and the blessings given to you by coming in the number of millions in divya suppression this is the mood of hindustan this diu repression is a small india there is no corner of hindustan which is not where people live here i was coming just now i was coming by car but

forward the love that is given is mood of hindustan this diu repression is a small india there is no corner of hindustan which is not where people live here i was coming just now i was coming by car but on a small india on both sides i saw people of every state of india were standing with their clothes i went there among them while worshiping them on foot brothers because we have to move the
