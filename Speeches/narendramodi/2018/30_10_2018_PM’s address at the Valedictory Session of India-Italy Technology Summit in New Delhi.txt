Harsh living,  Tech Summit  at  present Technology  associated with the world of  all partners in India and Italy, ladies and gentlemen  !Hello!Chao, Komai Stai!A specially warm welcome to all guests who come here from Italy!Benvenuto in India!Friends,The 24 Th  is Tech Summit. Italy's participation in this summit as Partner Country, as well as the dignified presence of Prime Minister Kunte, is a matter of pride for us.Before coming here, during my official visit, my expansion has been discussed with Prime Minister Mr. Kante. I have experienced my enthusiasm and commitment to relations with India.This year is also important for us as it is the 70th year of Diplomatic Relations of India and Italy. This year, our cooperation in the field of Science and Technology is completed 40 years. Prime Minister Kunte's visit to India on this auspicious occasion has a different significance.Friends,This is the time when it is difficult to imagine life without technology. Today almost every person's life is connected to technology in some form or the other. In the past few years, there has been a lot of change in the field of technology. Its speed is so fast that the effect of a technology does not reach the last end of the society so that it gets better technology. In such a situation, there is a challenge to run with the changing technology in front of all the countries, and there are many new opportunities.India has made technology a medium of social justice, empowerment, inclusion, competent government machinery and transparency. Effective last service delivery of government services is being ensured through technology. In particular, a comprehensive infrastructure of Digital Technology is being developed so that the general public can easily get the benefits of the facilities. We consider technology as an important medium of ease of living.Friends,Today one of the world's largest Direct Benefit Scheme is going on in India. Government help is being provided directly to the beneficiaries' bank accounts. Many facilities from Birth Certificate to Old Age Pension are online today. The services of more than 300 centers and state government have been brought on a platform through Umang App.Digital payments are now increasing at a speed of about two and a half million transactions per month. More than 3 lakh Common Service Centers across the country are providing online services in village-village.In the last 4 years, the cost of a GB data in India has decreased by more than 90 percent. This cheap data in India is becoming an effective medium for delivering digital technology to every person in the country.Friends,India is now moving forward to take the IT Software Power's identity to the next level.  We  are insisting on developing Technological Temperament  from  Scientific Temper in India  .Temperament is being developed for future technology, for innovation in schools through the Atal Tinkering Lab throughout the country. A network of youth is being created across the country through the Atal Innovation Mission, which will become the strongest pillar of the fourth industrial revolution.The result of these efforts of the Government is that in the ranking of the World Intellectual Property Organization, WIPO's Global Innovation Index, we have come up 21 places. Apart from this, today's world's second largest start-up ecosystem is in India.There is also emphasis on quality in the innovations that are taking place in India  . India's Space Program is a great example, and Italy has also realized its success.Today India is sending the satellite to many countries in the world, including Italy, at a very low cost. They are proving useful in extending the benefit of satellite technology to home.Friends, today, when the world is discussing Industry 4.0, strengthening cooperation between science and technology between the ancient civilizations of India and Italy will create new opportunities, but we will also be able to face the challenges effectively.Friends,Today India is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Ecosystem of India's vast Domestic Market, Young Population, Technology and Innovation, is going to be a strong engine of growth in the world.At the same time Italy has a rich heritage in science and technology. Italy's name in the world of manufacturing is known for best quality. Therefore, India and Italy together can strengthen their cooperation in High Quality Research. Through this cooperation we can prepare shared technologies for solving global challenges.This is the reason that strengthening the cooperation between science and technology for the betterment of the lives of people of both countries, clean the environment, science and technology for human welfare is the most necessary in comparison to earlier. I am happy that the scientific community and business leaders of both countries are collaborating in the areas of Cutting Edge of Research and Innovation. We have extensive cooperation in areas such as Renewable Energy, Environmental Science, Neuro Science, and IT to preserve cultural heritage.Friends,Along with strengthening this path of cooperation, our goal is to ensure that the results of research and development are not limited to labs but they also reach the society, the public. That's why I always say " science is universal, technology has to be local ".In India, we have started the Science and Heritage Research Initiative, i.e. SHRI, to preserve its historical heritage. Its purpose is to find solutions related to technology for the preservation and restoration of historical monuments. Technology, Tourism and History - The combination of the three appears in this initiative.I believe that by promoting Science, Technology and Innovation, new speed of development will be ensured. They will also have an important role in the development of our bilateral relations. This is the purpose of this Tech Summit.I am confident that in the last two days Summit will help in enhancing the technology transfer, joint ventures and market access between the two countries. This Summit will play an important role in discussing our shared future.Friends,Today, I am very happy to announce the introduction of the next phase of Indo-Italian bilateral Industrial Research and Development Cooperation Program. This will enable our industry and research institute to develop new products and prototypes without any interruption. " Know  how" , is the need of time to   change into " Show  how" .In order to strengthen economic relations between the two countries, we have also agreed that   a  CEO  Forum under the guidance of the Joint Commission on Economic Cooperation, JCEC is also constituted. Simultaneously,  to increase the two-way investments between the two countries, there  has been consensus on the formation of a Fast Track Mechanism  to remove the hindrances in doing business  .I am also happy that India and Italy   have agreed to increase cooperation in the field of LAD  i.e.  Style Style Accessories Design . There will also be special focus on leather sector,  Transportation & Automobile Design  ie  TAD  .Also, I am also happy to state that both countries will establish Indo-Italian Centers of Excellence based on skills in select areas such as conservation of cultural heritage, Renewable Energy, Life Sciences and Geo-Hazards. Not only will these high schools, research institutes and industry interconnect, but also the technical solutions to the challenges facing us.Friends,I congratulate all the organizers for the success of the Tech Summit.
