Many great wishes to all of you 2019 Budget session is going on today. After a while, the respected President will address the joint session of both the Houses. We have seen the stand of the House for the last time. Today there is an awareness in the country, every citizen is very closely watching the activity of the House. And today there is a lot of reach to reach every small event in the country, so all the things reach to the common man. And due to her lack of interest in the discussion, there is a natural displeasure in society towards those who are not interested in the debate.I hope that all our respected MPs should use these budget sessions deeply, in detail, full of information, discuss in the discussion, keep their views, benefit the House, and also to the Government Benefit and make the highest use of all of our respected MPs, as we have in this session; Such is my expectation from them and I also know that now even when they have to go to their respective areas, this time the good and positive behavior in the House, a positive advantage of it, also in the field, See also in the behavior of watching.I believe everybody will accept this seriousness. Together with everyone - all we have to do is take this mantra, we are committed to it even further, are committed. We also want to move forward in taking decisions with the people in the House to work for the development of the country. We will try our best, we are eager to discuss every subject. I will welcome the discussion with an open mind, I will welcome the proceedings of the House in a good manner, I will welcome that all the members here get the pride of joining us in making some contribution in the creation of a future India.Thanks a lot
